The paradigm of what comprises an effective library is changing as the needs of library users shift. Transitioning from a ‘dumb’ library of the past to a smart library of the future requires the strategic deployment of IoT systems to efficiently tackle the new demands. One vital application for smart library IoT devices would be in occupancy sensing, which is especially desired by users of university libraries. Desk-based occupancy sensors would reduce burdens faced by patrons when searching for a suitable workspace. A solution would need to be robust enough to deal with obstructions to data transmissions while being simple enough to not deter adoption. Deployment of a mesh-based desk sensor network can help limit complexity of individual devices while providing obstruction avoidance through a multi-hop transmission protocol. Artefact development culminated in a device whose core components consists of an ESP32 microcontroller and a single cell thermal sensor. Evaluation of the artefact shows the proposed solution can provide a reliable metric with regards to the current availability status of a workspace.
