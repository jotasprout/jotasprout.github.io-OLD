## Revature

First, [Revature](https://revature.com/) was kind enough to train me as a .NET Full Stack Developer. I learned a ton and got *lots* of practice. While they kicked me out at the end of the last day of training, I am not giving up and continue to practice.

## Books

The pace at Revature is fast and sometimes you don't catch everything so I bought these books which, honestly, I didn't have time to look at during the nine weeks of lectures.

## Udemy Courses I've purchased

- _Complete guide to building an app with .Net Core and React_ by Neil Cummings
- _ASP.NET Core 6.0 Course - MVC - Blazor - Razor - EF Core_ by Dennis Panjuta and others
- _Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch_ by Neil Cummings
