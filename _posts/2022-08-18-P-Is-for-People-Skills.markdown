I woke up about 2:30 AM EST. 

I made some coffee and wrote this in my journal:

> I do not want to be like Walter White -- his back story, let alone the last two years -- losing relatoinship after relationship, great opportunity and circumstance after another.

I logged on to **Second Life** while in this reflective mood and was visited by a person who is, fortunately, a true friend who listened. Cool thing about SL is you've got friends around the world who are up at all hours of the day.

**Me:** Do they show *Breaking Bad* in the Netherlands?

**Netherlander:** They do on Netflix.Haven't watched it. They lsot me with the first episode

**Me:** I'm fascinated by his back story and how much of him I see in me. Not in good ways.

**Netherlander:** yeah and I'm just completely alienated by all the characters

**Me:** Well, you know that before he was a "lowly" high school teacher -- he started this company that became huge? And had a couple other great jobs? Lost the all because of implied personality conflicts?

I then showed them three videos from *Breaking Bad* that always make me cry.
