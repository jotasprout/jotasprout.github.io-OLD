Resources I've purchased that have been waiting for me to pick them up.

## Books

Really, I've only found one or two books I liked at all about MySQL. These are old but they are still the best I've found.

- _Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript with jQuery, CSS & HTML5 4th Edition_ by Robin Nixon
- _Head First PHP & MySQL_ by Lynn Beighley & Michael Morrison

## Udemy Courses I've purchased

I'll let you know if they're any good.

- _Beginner PHP and MySQL Tutorial_ by Infinite Skills
- _Make a Spotify Clone from Scratch: JavaScript PHP and MySQL_ by Reece Kenney
