## Part 0: Introduction

The Bootstrap theme I want to use doesn't come with any of the moving parts that make it work so I am going to do something that always makes me miserable -- use multiple tutorials simultaneously and try to mix files from multiple projects thinking, "Sure, this'll work out just fine."

## From This To That

The theme I wanted, [Themelight by Themefisher](https://themefisher.com/products/themelight), is archived and only comes with some basic static files. 

My understanding is that I can take what I need from a complete theme so I've chosen one similar to mine -- [Navigator](https://demo.themefisher.com/navigator/) made by the same people -- from which to steal/salvage the necessary files. 

## Resources/Tutorials

It can't possible be as easy as it sounds so I've gathered these resources and tutorials to help me.
