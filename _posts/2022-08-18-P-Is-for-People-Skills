[00:39] Chance Hazelnut: yeah and I'm just completely alienated by all the characters
[00:40] Autumn Jersey: Well, you know that before he was a "lowly" high school teacher -- he started this company that became huge? And had a couple other great jobs? Lost the all because of implied personality conflicts?

[00:42] Autumn Jersey: Really? Tell me more, if you'd like.
[00:42] Chance Hazelnut: the worst personality conflicts I have in my work history are: "I thought you didn't like me.. " with my response "no I just had a bad mood that day. "
