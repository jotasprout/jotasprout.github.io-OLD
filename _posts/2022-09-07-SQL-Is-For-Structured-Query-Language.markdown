## "What more is there to learn?"

That's kinda what I thought when week three of my training at [Revature](https://revature.com/) started. Now, I knew there must be much, much more because I'd already purchased the courses listed at the bottom and, come on, looking at those names!

I'm also writing a course of my own -- stay tuned!

## Books

Really, I've only found one or two books I liked at all about MySQL.

- _Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript with jQuery, CSS & HTML5 4th Edition_ by Robin Nixon
- _Head First PHP & MySQL_ by Lynn Beighley & Michael Morrison

## Udemy Courses I've purchased

- _The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert_ by **Colt Steel** and Ian Schoonover
- _Beginner PHP and MySQL Tutorial_ by Infinite Skills
- _Database Design and MySQL_ by Caleb Curry
- _Make a Spotify Clone from Scratch: JavaScript PHP and MySQL_ by Reece Kenney
