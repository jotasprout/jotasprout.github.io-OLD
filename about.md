## This Blog

So many tutorials out there don't explain why they're telling you what they tell you. If you're one of those people who doesn't care and simply copies and pastes -- this blog is so not for you.

* I explain why you use certain commands or make certain choices. 
* I explain the little options in Linux commands
* As often as possible, I'll explain likely mistakes and their consequences

## Me

I've loved creating things my entire life. Solving problems and figuring out how things work are just a small part of this insatiable lifelong learner's very core. I've completed 10 out of 12 classes toward a Master's in Education with a 3.88 GPA. What I love most about programming is the power to bring any idea into reality, limited only by my imagination. The best thing about teaching was making peoples' lives and jobs better and easier. For me, being a full stack developer is the exact same thing. This is yet another opportunity where my work is play. 

I earned a full scholarship from **Google** to complete a **Mobile Web Specialist nanodegree** from Udacity. While completing that program, I served as a student leader which included tutoring and delivering workshops on self-marketing and building a portfolio.

While I've had a lot of very cool jobs, hands down my favorite was teaching the entire suite of Adobe products and web development at **New Horizons**, **LaSalle**, and a few contract agencies. I love learning and it seems I have a natural gift for making complex subjects user-friendly and the truly incomprehensible palatable to the layperson all while being engaging and entertaining. 

My last full time job was as an **Instructional Designer** at Tampa General Hospital where the pandemic gave me the opportunity to facilitate online live courses on employee and leadership development, soft skills, and career advancement.

I loved the Revature program and am currently rebuilding all my old PHP apps using the **.NET Core Full Stack** and am enjoying having time again to resume all my classes at **Udemy** and finish my certification projects at **FreeCodeCamp**. 

My biggest hope is that whatever city I end up in has a local chapter of **Code for America** - a national organization of volunteer civic hackers who help local governement and non-profits. If they don't, I'll just have to start one!
